# Task Tracker – Full Stack Learning Project

This is my **first full-stack project** built to understand how **frontend, backend, and database work together**.

The goal of this project is **learning**, not perfection.

---

##  What This Project Does

- Add a task
- View all tasks
- Delete a task
- Store data permanently using a database

##  Why I Built This

I am currently learning:
- How a frontend talks to a backend
- How APIs work
- How databases are connected
- How to structure a real project

This project helped me understand the **complete request–response flow**.
